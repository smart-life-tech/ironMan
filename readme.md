# Ironman Helmet Control

This Arduino code controls the functionality of an Ironman helmet. The code allows you to open and close the helmet's face using either a button or a Hall sensor. It also controls the movement of the face servos, lip servo, and eye LEDs accordingly.

## Components Used

- Arduino board
- Button (or Hall sensor)
- Two eye LEDs
- Two face servos
- One lip servo

## Pin Assignments

The code assumes the following pin assignments:

- Button/Hall Sensor Pin: 2
- First Eye LED Pin: 7
- Second Eye LED Pin: 8
- First Face Servo Pin: 3
- Second Face Servo Pin: 5
- Lip Servo Pin: 6

Please adjust the pin assignments in the code according to your specific setup.

## Button Control

If you are using a button for control, the code functions as follows:

- Pressing the button toggles the state of the helmet's face (open or closed).
- When the face is closed, the face servos gradually open the helmet, the lip servo closes the lip, and both eye LEDs turn on.
- When the face is open, the face servos gradually close the helmet, the lip servo opens the lip, and both eye LEDs turn off.

## Hall Sensor Control

If you are using a Hall sensor for control, the code functions as follows:

- The Hall sensor pin is connected to pin 2 (hallSensorPin).
- When the Hall sensor detects a magnetic field (HIGH), it indicates that the helmet face is closed.
- When the face is closed, the face servos gradually open the helmet, the lip servo closes the lip, and both eye LEDs turn on.
- When the Hall sensor does not detect a magnetic field (LOW), it indicates that the helmet face is open.
- When the face is open, the face servos gradually close the helmet, the lip servo opens the lip, and both eye LEDs turn off.

Please ensure that you have connected the Hall sensor properly and that it is configured to output HIGH when the face is closed and LOW when the face is open.

Make sure to adjust the angles of the servos and pin assignments in the code to match your specific setup.

Feel free to modify and enhance the code to suit your needs.

## Debugging

The code includes debugging messages via the Serial Monitor. Make sure to open the Serial Monitor in the Arduino IDE to view the messages. The program prints messages whenever the helmet face is opened or closed.

Make sure to properly connect the components and adjust the pin assignments in the code to match your setup. If you encounter any issues, refer to the documentation or datasheets of the components for further assistance.

Feel free to modify the code to add additional functionality or customize it according to your preferences.

Enjoy your Ironman helmet project!
